# FRC-Power-Up
This repository contains the code used by Team 5557 (BB-R8ERS) during FRC Power Up.

## Repository Guidelines
- Maintain code cleanliness - the IDE has an organize code function for a reason
- Write code that is easy for someone else to understand; don't give ambiguous names to variables and comment
- Make sure to commit and push all changes to GitHub
- Before editing any code, notify the Slack programming chat regarding which files you are working on
- Remember that two people cannot be working on one file at the same time - this causes GitHub to be confused and throw errors
- Make sure to use GitHub features such as the issue tracker

## Importing Project into Eclipse
1. Make sure you have the WPILib Java Eclipse plugins installed, follow the instructions [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13503/l/599679-installing-eclipse-c-java)
2. Use Git to clone the repository into the Eclipse workspace location
3. Create a new Robot Java Project, setting its name to the same value as the cloned Git folder (which should be `FRC-Steamworks` unless modified from the default value)
  - The project type should be Command-Based Robot
*Note: You may need to enter the team number if this is your first time setting up the project, which is `5557` in this case*

- You should now have a properly setup project in your Eclipse workspace

## Additional Notes
